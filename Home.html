                At food bridge we believe that when we share we share what we have,
                 we build a world where acces to food is a "right" not a previlege.
                Together we break acycle of hunger and off hope.its more than just a meal:its atestament to compassion, human dignity and solidarity.In each hand-ful of rice lies the promise of relief from hunger,
                nourishment for both body and spirit, and a reminder that no child should ever  have to wait for another's charity to eat. This simple act bridges the divide between 
               desparation and relief, turning what seems overwhelming into something tangible and every day possible.One loaf, one and at atime.
